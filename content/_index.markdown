## Software Engineering Leader

Hi there! I am Evgeny Soynov, software engineering leader and IT professional. I build teams of engineers in small and mid-size companies and hold strong focus on shipping.

Good projects exceed boundaries of internet and change the offline society. Thus my teams and projects are helping people. Interested to work on something new, unique, not yet common (i.e. no blockchains, shops, CRMs).

I'm the right person if you need someone to:

* help you to design your project from scratch or to find out how to achieve the better state with an existing one;
* train your teams to be happy, scalable and performing;
* plan the work on a project to avoid it burning in flames and the team burning out;
* find out why something, that was working for ten people no longer works for hundred and decide how to deal with it;
* look for a proper quality bar for your software developers and how to keep it;
* do many other things related to engineering leadership.
