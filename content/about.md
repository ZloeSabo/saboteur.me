Hey there! I am Evgeny Soynov, engineering lead and IT professional.
I build teams of engineers in small and mid-size companies and hold strong focus on shipping.

I've had great time and gained some experience building a small team as CTO for [Presto Heads][PrestoHeads] production agency. 
The challenge was to first set and then maintain gradual growth of team's performance, constantly fine tuning the development process, and keeping the team motivated for the long run.
We created and successfully delivered a dozen applications and websites for our clients, advertisement agencies.

Prior to this, another great place I worked at was a nice mid-size company [Bitmaster][Bitmaster].
Company's core product supports 2,500+ taxi and delivery services around the globe.
I joined to take position of Head of New Products in order to form a team of existing employees and new hires, establish the result-focused culture, and set up communications and processes to align the new department with company's mission.
One of the biggest product we worked on is unified microservice-based platform to unite the most critical services that collectively contribute to 90% of the revenue. Among them, sophisticated platform that allows users exchange their orders, high-availability gates for SMS and payments.
Among the most challenging technical tasks we solved with the team was error collection and reporting, and it allowed the Customer Support team to remove one extra step from their communication chain, resulting in 1/4 time efficiency increase.

Today, I'm looking for a new challenge that would involve team work and communication at large scale. Recently, I moved to Berlin to join [Wayfair](http://engineering.wayfair.com/) team.

Have questions, suggestions or a bit of curiosity? Feel free to drop me an email to [saboteur@saboteur.me](mailto:saboteur@saboteur.me).

Thanks for reading!
